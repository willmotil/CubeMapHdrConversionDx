The Goal of this MonoGame project is to create a Illumination map from the enviromental map as cheaply and quickly as possible.

The function GetIrradiance  can be found in the TextureCubeBuildEffect.fx this function needs some love any help is appreciated.

This project also serves as a demonstration for how to load HDRi files to TextureCubes useing a RenderTargetCube and a Quad.
It demonstrates conversion to and from 6 seperate images to and from spherical maps. 
It demonstrates the creation and display of a primitive skybox and cubes with these textures. 
The project can easily be modified to save the images.
There is also a incomplete but fairly decent waypoint camera as well made for the demo scene.

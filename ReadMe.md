The goal of this MonoGame project is to create a Illumination map from the enviromental map as cheaply and quickly as possible.

The function GetIrradiance  can be found in the TextureCubeBuildEffect.fx this function needs some help.

This project also serves as a example for how to load HDRi files to TextureCubes useing RenderTargetCubes and a Quad.
The project can easily be modified to output single face images from Hdr equarectangular maps or load in multiple images to build texture cubes or Hdr maps.

The goal of this project is to create a Illumination map from the enviromental map as cheaply and quickly as possible.

The function GetIrradiance  can be found in the TextureCubeBuildEffect.fx 

This project also serves as a example for how to load hdri files to TextureCubes useing RenderTargetCubes and a Quad.
The project can easily be modified to output single face images from Hdr equarectangular maps or load in multiple images to build texture cubes or Hdr maps.
